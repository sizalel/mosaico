Safari Hack: Safari create reflow glitches due to a webkit bug with border-spacing (cellspacing)
when the template being edited makes use of horizontal border spacing.
  See: https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/issues/53
The following are terrible hacks to make this happens less often.

It seems something similar happens to Chrome, too;
  See: https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/issues/85
So we broadened the application of this hack to include Chrome.

2019/02/19 Update: since Mozilla Firefox 63 (Sept 2018), Mozilla implemented 
"-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio", so this hack is currently being executed also by Firefox:
  See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media
We have no reports of side effects on Firefox resulting from this code being enabled.

After enabling the dashed outlines for editable contents we had reports from webkit based
browsers (Safari) users of flickering similar to the previous issues.
  See: https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/issues/430
Please note there is no space between "and" and the following bracket because we only
want to tarket webkit (Safari) and not blink (Chrome).
